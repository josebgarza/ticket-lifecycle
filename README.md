This was a simple example showing how a user creates a ticket, how it’s assigned, and the communication between agents leading to a resolution. In real scenarios, tickets can be reassigned, escalated, or transferred to a more qualified agent or department based on the issue’s severity and business impact. I hope this tutorial gives you a clearer understanding of the ticket life cycle. Help desk agents typically handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on company size.
